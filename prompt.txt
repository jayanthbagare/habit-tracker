I want you to build a habit tracker app for me. The tech and functional features are separated as below
Tech features
* Should be available on multiple phones to mark habits
* Should be minimalistic with typography in shades of gray
* Should be easily hosted on github pages/netlify/s3
* Should fit on mobile screens
* Use Supabase to store

Functional features
* Should give a screen for me to define, daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, quarterly and yearly habits
* Once defined I would log an habit as done, it should evaluate if it meets the timeline as well as count criteria. Eg.. practice guitar 3 times a week. Review investment once in a quarter. 
* If a habit is not on track, it should remind with notification early on, say for day habits at 9pm, week habits on friday afternoon and so on
* It should be a simple screen for me to track habits, something I can do very quickly even using a single hand
* A simple dashboard/report should be available to let me know what my slippages are
* Dashboard should be shaming in nature
